## Project Overview
Tomato leaf diseases can have a significant impact on crop yield and quality. This project aims to leverage machine learning to automate the identification of diseases from images of tomato leaves. By doing so, farmers and agricultural professionals can detect diseases early and take timely action.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of labeled images of tomato leaves with various diseases, as well as healthy leaves. It was sourced from publicly available datasets focused on plant pathology.

### Classes
- Healthy leaves
- Diseased leaves (specific diseases vary depending on the dataset)

## Model Architecture
The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Key features of the architecture include:
- **Input Layer**: Preprocessed images resized to a standard dimension.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from the images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce computational complexity.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine extracted features for classification.
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Training Results
The model was trained for 50 epochs using TensorFlow. Below is a detailed analysis of the training and validation accuracy and loss.

### Graph Analysis
#### Training and Validation Accuracy
The graph below shows how the training and validation accuracy evolved over the epochs. The training accuracy steadily increased, reaching close to 1.0, indicating that the model learned the patterns in the training data effectively. However, the validation accuracy exhibited more variability, suggesting potential overfitting or challenges with generalization.

#### Training and Validation Loss
The graph below illustrates the training and validation loss. The training loss decreased consistently, demonstrating that the model minimized the error on the training set. The validation loss, on the other hand, fluctuated significantly, which might indicate overfitting or noise in the validation data.

### Insights:
- The training process shows strong learning on the training set, as indicated by high accuracy and low loss.
- Validation accuracy and loss fluctuations suggest further steps, such as data augmentation or regularization, might improve the modelâ€™s performance.
